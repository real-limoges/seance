;;; Commentary:
;; TRANSPORT for seance: shoves the snapshot at the `claude' CLI in headless
;; mode (-p/--print). Runs on whatever subscription the CLI is logged into --
;; no API key.
;;
;; Which is the entire reason this exists next to seance-gptel.el. gptel can
;; talk to Claude too, but only if you hand it an API key.
;;
;; Wants the `claude' CLI on PATH and logged in (this is Claude Code itself).
;; Set `seance-claude-program' to an absolute path when a GUI Emacs can't find
;; it, which it usually can't.
